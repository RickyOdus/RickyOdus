- 👋 Hi, I’m @RickyOdus
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, Javascript AND React
- 🌱 I’m currently very good with HTML and CSS, I just started JavaScript and would be good at both JS and React in two months time from now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone on projects to build my portfolio,I pivoted from Mass Communication to Software engineering, so this is a new phase of my life and I am loving it. I also want to give it all I have got, and would do that.
- 📫 You can reach me via direct message/inbox for collabs.
