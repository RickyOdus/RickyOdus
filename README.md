- 👋 Hi, I’m @RickyOdus
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, Javascript (ReactJS) and Python(Django) at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently very good with HTML, CSS and Javascript (ReactJS). I just started using Python (Django framework) and I think I am enjoying this new journey as well. ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone on projects. I pivoted from studying Mass Communication (B.Sc, M.Sc) to M.Sc Computing, so this is a new phase of my life and I am loving it. I also want to give it all I have got, and I believe God got me.
- 📫 You can reach me via direct message/inbox for collabs.
