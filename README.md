- 👋 Hi, I’m @RickyOdus
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, Javascript AND ReactJS at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently very good with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I just started ReactJS and would be good at it soon enough. (Based on belief :))
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone on projects to build my portfolio, I pivoted from studying Mass Communication (B.Sc, M.Sc in view) to Software Engineering, so this is a new phase of my life and I am loving it. I also want to give it all I have got, and i believe God got me.
- 📫 You can reach me via direct message/inbox for collabs.
